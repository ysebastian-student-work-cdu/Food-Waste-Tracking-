Create 500 records in .csv format as a code block, with the following columns:

```
recipeID: integer.
recipeName: A name for a recipe.
userID: the ID for the user who created the recipe.
recipeDescription: a brief description of the recipe.
```

recipeID is an integer and must be sequential.

recipeName is a string can be any real dish for breakfast, lunch, dinner or dessert. Give 35% weighting to lunch and dinner, 20% to breakfast and 10% to dessert.

userID: Not every recipe was generated by the user so I'd like to have these records reflect that some of them were created by users. Ensure that only 25% of the recipes use a random integer between 1 and 1000, and are left blank otherwise.

recipeDescription is a string providing a brief description of the recipe.

note: I don't want a script to create these records, I want them generated by ChatGPT. Ensure strings in records are encased in double quotes.
