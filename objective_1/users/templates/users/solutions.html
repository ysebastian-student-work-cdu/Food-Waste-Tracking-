    <h1>Solutions to Food Waste</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Reducing overproduction: <br> One solution to food waste is to reduce overproduction at every stage of the food supply chain, including at the farm level, processing and distribution centers, and retailers.</li>

        <li>Improving storage and transportation:<br> Proper storage and transportation techniques can help to reduce spoilage and food waste. This includes using appropriate temperature control measures, packaging, and handling procedures.</li>

        <li>Food recovery and donation:<br> Food recovery programs can help to divert edible food from landfills and provide it to people in need. These programs can involve donations to food banks, soup kitchens, and other community organizations.</li>

        <li>Educating consumers: <br> Consumer education campaigns can help raise awareness about the impact of food waste and provide tips on how to reduce it at home. This includes education on proper food storage, meal planning, and portion control.</li>

        <li>Sustainable food production and consumption: <br> Sustainable agriculture practices, such as reducing pesticide use and improving soil health, can help to reduce food waste by increasing crop yields and reducing post-harvest losses. Sustainable consumption practices, such as reducing food waste at home and choosing to buy only what is needed, can also help to reduce food waste.</li>

        <li>Standardizing expiration dates: <br> Confusing expiration dates and labeling can cause consumers to waste edible food. Standardizing expiration dates and labeling can help consumers better understand when food is still safe to consume.</li>

        <li>Repurposing food waste: <br> Repurposing food waste into animal feed, composting, or energy generation can help to reduce the amount of food waste that ends up in landfills.</li>

        <li>Encouraging innovation: <br> Encouraging innovation in food waste reduction technologies, such as new packaging materials and improved processing techniques, can help to further reduce food waste.</li>
        <li>Landfill/Incineration: <br> A last resort for unused food.</li>
    </ul>
