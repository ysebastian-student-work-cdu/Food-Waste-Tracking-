    <h1>Facts about Food Waste</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Approximately one-third of all food produced globally is lost or wasted. This amounts to 1.3 billion tons of food annually. (FAO)</li>

        <li>In high-income countries, per capita food waste by consumers is between 95-115 kg per year, while in sub-Saharan Africa and South/Southeast Asia, it is only 6-11 kg per year. (FAO)</li>

        <li>Food waste occurs at different stages of the food supply chain. In high-income countries, 40% of food waste occurs at the consumer level, while in low-income countries, 40% of food waste occurs at the post-harvest and processing stages. (FAO)</li>

        <li>Food waste contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. If food waste were a country, it would be the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the United States. (FAO)</li>

        <li>The economic costs of food waste are significant. In the United States, the economic cost of food waste is estimated at $218 billion annually. (ReFED)</li>

        <li>Food waste exacerbates food insecurity and hunger. The amount of food wasted globally could feed 2 billion people, which is more than the number of undernourished people in the world. (FAO)</li>

        <li>Reducing food waste has significant environmental and economic benefits. For example, reducing food waste by 25% globally could feed 870 million people and save 8% of global freshwater resources. (FAO)</li>

        <li>Consumers can play an important role in reducing food waste. In the United States, households are responsible for 43% of all food waste, and reducing household food waste could save consumers up to $1,500 annually. (ReFED)</li>

        <li>Sustainable food production and consumption practices can help reduce food waste. For example, using sustainable agricultural practices, such as reducing pesticide use and improving soil health, can reduce food waste by increasing crop yields and reducing post-harvest losses. (FAO)</li>
        
        <li>Food recovery programs can help divert edible food from landfills and provide it to people in need. In the United States, food recovery programs could provide an additional 1.8 billion meals annually to people in need. (ReFED)</li>
